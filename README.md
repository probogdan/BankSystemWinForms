# BankSystemWinForms
Bank sistem on win forms. Just options no much UI.
This is a project created in Visual Studio 2015. In it i created a bank system functions. First of all we've got an admin. He can registrate new users.
Registred users are added to table Authorization in DataBase. Users, first of all, got no personal information. So they can fill the fields 
of informotion. In this system we've got different banks. Users can create new bank accout. This bank account will be with special type. Of caurse
to pay something you need to deposit. It function made just us update of you bank accaunt ton depend on how you will deposit. We got different 
services to pay. For example - internet, light, TV etc. When you  pay system will save from what BankAccout payment were made, to what service and 
from where. By from where i mean different filials. Id is some thing like geographical position of banks. There are some banks in one filial(position).
In system there is some kind of logging. When user change his personal information - system will save last personal information and date of changing. Admin 
can whatch all users, thier Bank Accouns, their payments, and can add/delete users from system. Thats all i think. If u interesting in this project, you
should know that it works with stored procedures. Dont forget to change path of DataBase.
