First of all you need to create DATABASE. I worked in sql server management studio. Cteate BD with name of "Bank1". Then in folder "DataBase"
you'll see sl scripts. Open it in sl server and start it. Script contains tables and stored procedures. You need to change connection path in project.
One path were automaticly create and saved in App.config, but i use another one, in main Form. You wont miss it. I worked in Visual Studio 2015/
You will need to add DataBase from SQL SERVER to Visual Studio(to get the right path), then copy your DB path to project. Thats should be all.
